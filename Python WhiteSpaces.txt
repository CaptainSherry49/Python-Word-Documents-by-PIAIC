WhiteSpaces
               Whitespace is meaningful in Python Especially indentation and placement of newlines

Use a newline to end  a line of code
  Use \ When must go to next line permaturaly

No braces {} to mark blocks of code , use consitsntent indentation instead
  *first line with less indentation is outside of the block 
  *First line with more indentation start a nested block

Colors start of a new block in many constructs, e.g . function definition, then clauses.
